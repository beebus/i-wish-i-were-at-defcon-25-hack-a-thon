My experience with Raspberry Pi
###############################
:Course  : COSC-2325 - Computer Architecture and Machine Language
:School  : Austin Community College
:Semester: Spring 2019

The professor teaching this class was retiring after that semester and I think he became accustomed to the ACC library always having a million Raspberry Pi and Arduino kits to lend out. For some reason, there were fewer. Luckily for me, I knew that my sister and her housemate had a couple old ones just sitting around their house from the activities they do at the library. What made it difficult was he assigned us into groups of 2-4 people. However, that semester, the school decided it needed to lock down their Wifi with an ACC ID and password. Seems typical. However the professor was upset at the school and the librarians because he was teaching that class in that particular manner for a long time (relying on open, unsecure Wifi).

While we were in the classroom / computer lab, we couldn't do any actual work on it. It was against school policy to mess with the ethernet jacks. So we divided up the work and took turns taking one home. Oh, 1 of the 2 kits I received did not work. Luckily, there was 2.

Anyways, the 2 kits I picked up from my sister are called CanaKit (I think they are a Canadian company because I saw a US and a Canadian flag on some of the paperwork). The specific one I have is a CanaKit Raspberry Pi 2 Ultimate Starter Kit (Black Case), which they don't sell any more, but if you go to their website, https://www.canakit.com, you can see they have a slimmer model which is only Wifi and has less ports, and then they have their brand new "Monster Truck" Raspberry Pi 4 Starter MAX Kit with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage... and that's not all, it supports dual monitors!

I've added a folder with the instructions the professor gave us, a folder with just some screenshots of my TV as things were installed and configured, and then our finished mini-report.

Also, here's a link to a second project we did with Arduinos:

You can compare to what other groups put together with Arduinos and a module.
